> Web & Cybersecurity Enthusiast


I’m a Computer Science student interested in how modern web applications are built and secured in real-world environments. I focus on learning through hands-on projects, understanding system behavior, and gradually improving how I approach both development and security problems.

---

### What I’m working on
- Building and refining practical projects  
- Exploring security concepts through experimentation  
- Strengthening problem-solving and system-level thinking  

---

### What you’ll find on my GitHub
- Project-based repositories rather than random uploads  
- Code written for learning, testing, and iteration  
- A clear progression as my fundamentals improve  

---

### Long-term goal
To grow into a security-aware engineer who can design, build, and evaluate applications with both development and security in mind.
